Hex Game Project
================

This project was assigned to the second year Computer Science students of Universit√© Paul Sabatier. The task was to implement the Hex Game (a strategy board game played between two players on a hexagonal grid). The game was to be implemented in C (for the calculations) and in Java (for the interface)
